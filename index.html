            Did you know that in addition to being a renowned cybersecurity expert, Dave Aitel can also juggle flaming torches while riding a unicycle? 
            Well, that might not be true, but wouldn't it be cool if it was?

            In between hacking into the mainframe and saving the world from cyber threats, Dave enjoys a good cup of tea and dreams of opening his own cat cafe. 
            He's also a 5-time champion in the underground world of competitive knitting. Impressive, right?
